# Gold Medal Metrics

Creating SQL queries to power an Olympics analytics web app

## Project Overview

In this project I wrote the SQL statements for an Olympic metrics reporting web application called Gold Medal Metrics.

Gold Medal Metrics allows users to:

- View countries in a list with their population, GDP, and number of Olympic gold medals.
- Sort the list of countries by any of these attributes, as well as alphabetically by name.
- View a detailed description of a country, with statistics on their Olympic wins.
- View a list of every Olympic win a country has with the year, season, winner name, city, and event.
- Sort the list of Olympic wins by any of these attributes.

## To Run

To view the webpage, run `npm run webpack` to compile the front-end files, and follow that with `open index.html` from the root directory. To start the server, run `npm install` and then `node server.js`. Refresh your browser to collect the information from the server.

## Testing

To run the testing suite, run `npm run test`. This project is in a completed state and hence all tests pass.
